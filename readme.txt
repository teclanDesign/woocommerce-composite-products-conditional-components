Adds a custom "Hide Components" Scenario action for conditionally hiding Composite Components. Requires WooCommerce Composite Products.

== Description ==

[Composite Products](http://www.woothemes.com/products/composite-products/) is an official [WooCommerce](http://www.woothemes.com/woocommerce/) extension suitable for creating dynamic product kits made up of multiple components, such as custom computers, skateboards, gift-boxes and made-to-order jewellery. Composite Products includes **Scenarios**, a powerful, developer-oriented feature that allows you to associate custom **actions** with specific configuration **states** of a Composite Product. By default, Scenarios can be used to conditionally **enable or disable specific Component Options** at every step of the configuration, depending on previous product/variation selections. You can find out more about Scenarios by taking a look at [the documentation](http://docs.woothemes.com/document/composite-products/) of the extension.

**Composite Products - Conditional Components** is a Composite Products plugin that relies on Scenarios and allows you to **conditionally hide one or more Components** depending on product/variation selections. The plugin works by adding a new **Hide Components** Scenario action.

Developers may checkout and contribute to the plugin at its [GitHub Repository](http://github.com/somewherewarm/woocommerce-composite-products-conditional-components).

**Important**: Before using this plugin ensure that you have installed the latest versions of both **WooCommerce** and **WooCommerce Composite Products**.

== Installation ==

1. Install the latest versions of WooCommerce and WooCommerce Composite Products.
2. Upload the plugin to the **/wp-content/plugins/** directory.
3. Activate the plugin through the **Plugins** menu in WordPress.
