Adds a custom "Hide Components" Scenario action that can be used to conditionally hide Composite Components.

== Description ==

The Composite product type is ideal for offering dynamic product kits made up of multiple components, such as custom computers, skateboards, gift-boxes and made-to-order jewellery.

The powerful Composite type makes building even the most complex product kit a breeze: To create a new Composite product, just add a few components, populate them with product options and adjust their layout.

Conditional Components is a Composite Products plugin that makes it possible to conditionally hide one or more Components depending on product/variation selections. The plugin works by adding an "Hide Components" Scenario action.

== Installation ==

1. Upload the plugin to the **/wp-content/plugins/** directory
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
